https://pnpm.io/installation_

_The monorepo uses [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) along with Turborepo to manage
build orchestration, to learn more about Turborepo please see the
[docs](https://turbo.build/repo/docs)._

### Install a package

If you want to install a new npm package in a sub application like `frontend-v3` add the --filter
option to your install command, e.g.:

```
pnpm add some-pkg --filter=frontend-v3
```

This filter should match the `name` attribute in the app or package package.json.

## Turborepo

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as
[Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache
artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with
Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the
following commands:

```
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your
[Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the
root of your Turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
