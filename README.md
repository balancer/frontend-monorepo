# Balancer frontend monorepo

_This project uses `pnpm`, if you haven't already installed it you can find the documentation here:
https://pnpm.io/installation_

The monorepo uses [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) along with Turborepo to manage build orchestration,
to learn more about Turborepo please see the
[docs](https://turbo.build/repo/docs).

****
## What's inside?

This monorepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps
- `
- `docs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `@repo/ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
- `@repo/eslint-config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `@repo/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

### Build

cd my-turborepo
pnpm build
```

### Develop

```
cd my-turborepo
pnpm dev

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
