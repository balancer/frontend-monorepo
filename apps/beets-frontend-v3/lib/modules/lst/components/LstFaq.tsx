    question: 'What is stS?',
    answer:
      'stS is a liquid-staked token that users receive when they stake $S on the Beets platform. The value of stS naturally appreciates in relation to $S thanks to native network staking rewards from validator delegation being automatically compounded within the token.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the stS fees?',
    answer:
      'Due to the management of underlying nodes, validators earn 15% of the overall stS staking rewards. Beets also takes a 10% protocol fee on the rewards after the validator fees. The APY displayed on the UI is the APY the user receives (all fees have been subtracted automatically).',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I get stS tokens?',
    answer:
      'To stake, users simply need to head to the stS page and select how much $S they wish to deposit. As an alternative to staking, users can swap into stS on DEXs by swapping their $S for stS on the Swap Page.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I unstake stS for $S?',
    answer:
      'Unstaking stS involves a 14-day unbonding period aligned with staking on Sonic. After initiating the unstake, users will need to return to the UI after 14 days to claim $S. For instant liquidity, users can swap stS for $S directly on DEXs via the Swap Page. However, note that swapping may offer a less favorable exchange rate than unstaking, depending on the poolâ€™s liquidity.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Where can I use stS tokens?',
    answer:
      'stS is fully liquid, meaning you can use stS seamlessly across DeFi and access lending markets, liquidity pools, and more without pausing your rewards.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the stS exchange rate and how does it change?',
    answer:
      'The stS token accrues staking rewards via delegating the underlying $S to trustworthy validators on the network. Every time staking rewards are added to the pool, the stS exchange rate to $S increases.',
  },
