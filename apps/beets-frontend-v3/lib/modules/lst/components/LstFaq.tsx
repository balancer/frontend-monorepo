    question: 'What is stS?',
    answer: (
      <Text color="font.primary" fontSize="lg" fontWeight="thin">
        stS is a liquid-staked token that users receive when they stake $S on the Beets platform.
        The value of stS naturally appreciates in relation to $S thanks to native network staking
        rewards from validator delegation being automatically compounded within the token.

    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the stS fees?',
    answer: (
      <Text color="font.primary" fontSize="lg" fontWeight="thin">
        Due to the management of underlying nodes, validators earn 15% of the overall stS staking
        rewards. Beets also takes a 10% protocol fee on the rewards after the validator fees. The
        APY displayed on the UI is the APY the user receives (all fees have been subtracted
        automatically).

  {
    question: 'How do I get stS tokens?',
    answer: (
      <Text color="font.primary" fontSize="lg" fontWeight="thin">
        To stake, users simply need to head to the stS page and select how much $S they wish to
        deposit. As an alternative to staking, users can swap into stS on DEXs by swapping their $S
        for stS on the Swap Page.
      </Text>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I unstake stS for $S?',
    answer: (
      <Text color="font.primary" fontSize="lg" fontWeight="thin">
        Unstaking stS involves a 14-day unbonding period aligned with staking on Sonic. After
        initiating the unstake, users will need to return to the UI after 14 days to claim $S. For
        instant liquidity, users can swap stS for $S directly on DEXs via the Swap Page. However,
        note that swapping may offer a less favorable exchange rate than unstaking, depending on the
        poolâ€™s liquidity.

  {
    question: 'Where can I use stS tokens?',
    answer: (
      <Text color="font.primary" fontSize="lg" fontWeight="thin">
        stS is fully liquid, meaning you can use stS seamlessly across DeFi and access lending
        markets, liquidity pools, and more without pausing your rewards.
      </Text>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the stS exchange rate and how does it change?',
    answer: (
      <Text color="font.primary" fontSize="lg" fontWeight="thin">
        The stS token accrues staking rewards via delegating the underlying $S to trustworthy
        validators on the network. Every time staking rewards are added to the pool, the stS
        exchange rate to $S increases.

    answer: (

        To mitigate smart contract risks, the stS code has been thoroughly audited by leading
        security firms, including{' '}
